The node servers don't have an external IP address and cannot be accessed externally. Once you have installed Db2 in CP4D, the usual way to vie the database externally is by using NodePort access. In our case this is not working since the node cannot be viewed externally. The solution is to use a Load Balancer that needs to be added. Here is the procedure. Log in to Openshift environment and go to your CP4D project. $ oc login -u apikey -p XXXXXXXX --server=https://c100-e.eu-de.containers.cloud.ibm.com:NNNN Login successful.
